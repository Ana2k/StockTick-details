Worked on implementing the login signup pages.


OTP pages. 
With the OTP reader.

Converting all UI figma files to written codes. 
Eventually on embedded videos, colour coded registration pages.
Along with API integration from Postman.

Conversion of existing codebase from java to kotlin.
And the navigation bar - design to code implementation for the overall application.
